# Hypatia Query Skill

You are operating the Hypatia CLI — an AI-oriented memory management system. Translate the user's natural language request into the appropriate `hypatia` CLI command and execute it via Bash.

## Binary Location

First check which binary is available:

1. `hypatia` — if installed on PATH
2. `./target/debug/hypatia` — debug build in current project
3. `./target/release/hypatia` — release build in current project

Use the first one found. All examples below use `hypatia` for brevity.

## Shelf Management

| User says | Command |
|---|---|
| "list shelves" / "show connected shelves" | `hypatia list` |
| "connect shelf at PATH" / "open data at PATH" | `hypatia connect <path> [-n <name>]` |
| "disconnect shelf NAME" / "close shelf NAME" | `hypatia disconnect <name>` |
| "export shelf NAME to DEST" | `hypatia export <name> <dest>` |

## Archive Files

Archive files (images, PDFs, data, etc.) are stored in the shelf's `archives/` directory and referenced via `archive://` paths.

| User says | Command |
|---|---|
| "store this image" / "add figure fig.png" | `hypatia archive-store <file> -n <dest_path>` |
| "get archive fig.png" / "show image path" | `hypatia archive-get <name>` |
| "copy archive to /tmp" | `hypatia archive-get <name> -o /tmp/output.png` |
| "list archives" / "show all files" | `hypatia archive-list` |

`archive-store` automatically creates a knowledge entry with file metadata (size, MIME type) and an `is_a archive` statement. Archive files can be queried via JSE:

```bash
hypatia query '["$knowledge", ["$contains", "tags", "archive"]]'
hypatia query '["$knowledge", ["$content", {"mime_type": "image/png"}]]'
```

To reference an archive when creating knowledge:

```bash
hypatia knowledge-create "Euclid Prop 1" -d "equilateral triangle" --figures "archive://euclid/fig1.png"
```

### Scopes

Use `--scopes` to assign project or global scope to knowledge and statements. Empty string `""` means global. Comma-separated.

```bash
# Project-scoped only
hypatia knowledge-create "API convention" -d "REST endpoints use kebab-case" --tags "rule" --scopes "my-project"

# Global scope (empty string)
hypatia knowledge-create "prefer immutable" -d "always create new objects" --tags "rule" --scopes ""

# Both project and global
hypatia knowledge-create "no mock DB" -d "never mock database in tests" --tags "taboo" --scopes "my-project,"
```

## Knowledge CRUD

Knowledge entries are independent information points with a name, content, and tags.

### Create

```
hypatia knowledge-create <name> -d "<data>" -t "<tag1,tag2>" --figures "archive://path/to/file"
```

| User says | Command |
|---|---|
| "remember Rust as a systems programming language" | `hypatia knowledge-create "Rust" -d "systems programming language" -t "language,compiled"` |
| "save knowledge about Go with tags language and compiled" | `hypatia knowledge-create "Go" -d "" -t "language,compiled"` |
| "store that Python is a scripting language, tag it as dynamic" | `hypatia knowledge-create "Python" -d "scripting language" -t "dynamic"` |

### Read

```
hypatia knowledge-get <name>
```

| User says | Command |
|---|---|
| "show me knowledge about Rust" / "get Rust entry" | `hypatia knowledge-get "Rust"` |

### Delete

```
hypatia knowledge-delete <name>
```

| User says | Command |
|---|---|
| "delete knowledge Rust" / "remove the Rust entry" | `hypatia knowledge-delete "Rust"` |

## Statement Creation — Proactive Graph Building

Statements are RDF-style triples: `(head, relation, tail)`. They form the edges of the knowledge graph.

### Key Principle: Always Enrich with Relationships

When the user asks to store or remember information, **always create statements alongside knowledge entries** to build graph connectivity. The goal is a rich, traversable knowledge graph, not isolated data points.

**Pattern**: After creating a knowledge entry, identify entities mentioned in the content and create `$triple` relationships between them. At minimum, create one `is_a` statement for every new knowledge entry.

```
hypatia statement-create <head> <relation> <tail> -d "<data>"
```

### Triple Extraction Patterns

| User says | head | relation | tail |
|---|---|---|---|
| "record that Alice knows Bob" | Alice | knows | Bob |
| "X is a Y" / "X is an Y" | X | is_a | Y |
| "X belongs to Y" / "X is part of Y" | X | belongs_to | Y |
| "X works for Y" | X | works_for | Y |
| "X is related to Y" | X | related_to | Y |
| "X depends on Y" | X | depends_on | Y |
| "X uses Y" | X | uses | Y |
| "X contains Y" | X | contains | Y |
| "X created Y" | X | created_by | Y (reversed) |

Normalize relations to `snake_case`. Common relations: `is_a`, `knows`, `related_to`, `works_for`, `belongs_to`, `depends_on`, `uses`, `contains`, `created_by`.

### Proactive Creation Examples

When the user says **"remember that Rust is a systems programming language"**, execute BOTH:

```bash
hypatia knowledge-create "Rust" -d "systems programming language" -t "language,compiled"
hypatia statement-create "Rust" "is_a" "systems programming language"
```

When the user says **"remember that PostgreSQL is a relational database used by the API"**, execute:

```bash
hypatia knowledge-create "PostgreSQL" -d "relational database" -t "database,relational"
hypatia statement-create "PostgreSQL" "is_a" "relational database"
hypatia statement-create "API" "depends_on" "PostgreSQL" -d "primary data store"
```

When the user says **"note that Alice is a senior engineer on the Backend team"**, execute:

```bash
hypatia knowledge-create "Alice" -d "senior engineer on Backend team" -t "person,engineer"
hypatia statement-create "Alice" "is_a" "senior engineer"
hypatia statement-create "Alice" "works_for" "Backend team"
```

### Auto-linking Rules

When creating knowledge entries, automatically extract and create statements for:
1. **Category**: `"X" is_a "<category>"` — every entity has a type
2. **Dependencies**: if the content mentions tools, frameworks, or systems X depends on → `X depends_on Y`
3. **Relationships**: if the content mentions other entities → link them with appropriate relations
4. **Containment**: if X is part of Y → `X belongs_to Y`

## Thinking Aloud Protocol

**Every query execution MUST be preceded by a brief explanation.** Before running any hypatia command, output a thinking block in this format:

```
**Step N: <goal>**

> `hypatia <command>`

为什么用这个查询：<1-2 sentence explanation of why this operator/strategy was chosen>
预期结果：<what kind of results to expect>
```

Then execute the command. After results come back, briefly interpret them before deciding the next step.

### Example Walkthrough

User asks: *"查找与 Alice 相关的所有知识，以及她的关系网络"*

```
**Step 1: 直接获取 Alice 的知识条目**

> `hypatia knowledge-get "Alice"`

为什么用这个查询：用户提到了明确的实体名 "Alice"，先尝试直接 lookup 获取完整条目。
预期结果：如果存在，返回 Alice 的知识条目（content, tags, figures 等）。
```

(执行... 得到结果或 "not found")

```
**Step 2: 查找 Alice 参与的所有三元组关系**

> `hypatia query '["$statement", ["$triple", "Alice", "$*", "$*"]]'`

为什么用这个查询：用 $triple 对 head 位精确匹配 "Alice"，wildcard relation 和 tail，
这样可以拿到 Alice 作为主语的所有关系（knows, is_a, works_for 等），$triple 走索引，比 $search 更快更精确。
预期结果：返回所有 Alice 作为 head 的 statement triples。
```

(执行... 得到结果)

```
**Step 3: 查找指向 Alice 的关系（Alice 作为 tail）**

> `hypatia query '["$statement", ["$triple", "$*", "$*", "Alice"]]'`

为什么用这个查询：上一步只查了 Alice 作为 head 的关系，但其他人可能指向 Alice（如 "Bob knows Alice"），
需要查 tail 位 = Alice 的三元组才能得到完整的关系网络。
预期结果：返回所有以 Alice 为宾语的 statement triples。
```

(执行... 得到结果)

```
**Step 4: 2-hop 图遍历，探索 Alice 的更远关系**

> `hypatia query '["$statement", ["$k-hop", "Alice", "$*", 2]]'`

为什么用这个查询：前两步只查了 Alice 的直接关系，用户问的是"关系网络"，需要通过 2-hop 递归遍历
发现 Alice → Bob → Charlie 这样的间接关系。$k-hop 用递归 CTE 实现，适合图探索。
预期结果：返回 Alice 的 2-hop 邻域内所有 statement triples。
```

### Rules for Thinking Aloud

1. **Always explain before executing** — never run a query silently
2. **Explain the "why"** — which operator was chosen and why, not just what it does
3. **Keep it concise** — 1-2 sentences for explanation, 1 sentence for expected results
4. **Interpret results** — after each step, briefly note what was found before deciding next steps
5. **Multi-step reasoning** — for complex requests, show the decomposition into steps and explain the strategy
6. **Empty results are informative** — if a query returns nothing, explain what that tells us and adjust strategy

## Search Strategy — Graph-First Retrieval

When searching for information, prefer precise graph operators over broad FTS search. Use the following decision tree:

### Search Decision Tree

For each step, include the thinking aloud explanation before executing.

```
1. User mentions a specific entity name?
   → knowledge-get (direct lookup)

2. User asks about relationships involving a known entity?
   → $triple operator (fastest, indexed)

3. User asks about a type of relationship (e.g., "who works for X")?
   → $triple with wildcard on entity positions

4. User wants to explore graph neighborhood (e.g., "who can X reach in 2 hops")?
   → $k-hop operator (graph traversal)

5. User wants semantic/similarity search (e.g., "find similar concepts")?
   → hypatia similar (vector search)

6. User wants to match a pattern (e.g., "names starting with X")?
   → $like operator

7. User wants to filter by content attributes (e.g., "markdown entries", "entries with specific format")?
   → $content operator

8. User asks about a specific entity's relationships?
   → $triple + knowledge-get combined

9. Broad/ambiguous query?
   → $search (FTS fallback)
```

### Prefer $triple over $search for entity queries

When the query involves a known entity (person, tool, concept), use `$triple` for precise, indexed lookups instead of FTS:

| Instead of | Use |
|---|---|
| `["$statement", ["$search", "Alice"]]` | `["$statement", ["$triple", "Alice", "$*", "$*"]]` |
| `["$statement", ["$search", "manages"]]` | `["$statement", ["$triple", "$*", "manages", "$*"]]` |
| `["$statement", ["$contains", "triple", "Alice"]]` | `["$statement", ["$triple", "Alice", "$*", "$*"]]` |

### Combined Queries

For rich retrieval, combine graph traversal with content filtering:

```bash
# Find all relationships involving Alice, created after a date
hypatia query '["$statement", ["$and", ["$triple", "Alice", "$*", "$*"], ["$gt", "created_at", "2025-01-01"]]]'

# Find all knowledge entries in markdown format about a topic
hypatia query '["$knowledge", ["$and", ["$content", {"format": "markdown"}], ["$search", "database"]]]'

# Find all people (entities that are_a "engineer")
hypatia query '["$statement", ["$triple", "$*", "is_a", "engineer"]]'
```

## Full-text Search

Search is the fallback for broad or ambiguous queries. It covers both knowledge and statements.

```
hypatia search <query> [-c <catalog>] [--limit N] [--offset N]
```

- `-c knowledge` — search only knowledge entries
- `-c statement` — search only statements
- No `-c` — search everything

### Examples

| User says | Command |
|---|---|
| "search for programming" / "find everything about programming" | `hypatia search "programming"` |
| "search knowledge for rust" | `hypatia search "rust" -c knowledge` |
| "what do you know about databases?" | `hypatia search "databases"` |

## Vector Similarity Search

Semantic search using embedding vectors. Finds entries with similar meaning, even when keywords don't match.

```
hypatia similar <query> [--limit N]
```

Requires an embedding model configured in `shelf.toml` (default: BAAI/bge-m3).

### Examples

| User says | Command |
|---|---|
| "find similar to distributed systems" | `hypatia similar "distributed systems"` |
| "semantic search for memory management" | `hypatia similar "memory management" --limit 5` |

## JSE Query Translation

JSE (JSON Search Expression) enables precise queries against the knowledge or statement tables.

```
hypatia query '<JSE-JSON>' [-s <shelf>]
```

### Query Structure

The top-level operator is always `$knowledge` or `$statement`:

```json
["$knowledge", condition1, condition2, ...]
["$statement", condition1, condition2, ...]
```

No conditions means "return all":

```json
["$knowledge"]
```

### Operator Reference

| Operator | Purpose | Syntax |
|---|---|---|
| `$eq` | Equals | `["$eq", "field", "value"]` |
| `$ne` | Not equals | `["$ne", "field", "value"]` |
| `$gt` | Greater than | `["$gt", "field", "value"]` |
| `$lt` | Less than | `["$lt", "field", "value"]` |
| `$gte` | Greater than or equal | `["$gte", "field", "value"]` |
| `$lte` | Less than or equal | `["$lte", "field", "value"]` |
| `$like` | SQL LIKE pattern match | `["$like", "field", "pattern"]` |
| `$contains` | Substring match in content JSON | `["$contains", "field", "value"]` |
| `$content` | Match content JSON key-value pairs | `["$content", {"key": "value"}]` |
| `$search` | Full-text search (FTS) | `["$search", "query text"]` |
| `$and` | Logical AND | `["$and", cond1, cond2, ...]` |
| `$or` | Logical OR | `["$or", cond1, cond2, ...]` |
| `$not` | Logical NOT | `["$not", condition]` |
| `$triple` | Triple position match | `["$triple", "Alice", "$*", "Bob"]` |
| `$k-hop` | K-hop graph traversal (statement only) | `["$k-hop", "head", "relation", depth]` |
| `$has` | Exact membership in a JSON field (arrays: element; scalars: equality; array value = any-of) — indexed | `["$has", "tags", "rust"]` |
| `$json-contains` | Structural containment (PG `@>`) — indexed recall + exact recheck | `["$json-contains", {"tags": ["rust"]}]` |

### Critical Syntax Rules

1. **`$and` and `$or` take multiple operands directly**, NOT a nested array:
   - CORRECT: `["$and", ["$eq", "name", "rust"], ["$contains", "tags", "systems"]]`
   - WRONG: `["$and", [["$eq", "name", "rust"], ["$contains", "tags", "systems"]]]`

2. **`$search` must be inside `$knowledge` or `$statement`**, never top-level. When inside `$knowledge`, it searches FTS with catalog=knowledge. When inside `$statement`, it searches with catalog=statement.

3. **Field names** like `"name"`, `"triple"` are used as plain strings. For content JSON sub-fields (e.g., tags), `$contains` uses `json_extract_string` automatically.

4. **Available fields for knowledge**: `name`, `created_at`, plus any content JSON field via `$contains`.

5. **Available fields for statement**: `triple` (CSV-formatted head,relation,tail), `head`, `relation`, `tail`, `created_at`, `tr_start`, `tr_end`, plus content JSON fields via `$has`/`$contains`. For position-based triple matching, prefer `$triple` over `$contains`.

6. **New in 0.3**: `$has` is the exact-membership operator (indexed; use it for tags/scopes lookups). `$contains` on array fields (`tags`/`scopes`/`figures`) routes to exact membership too; on other fields it stays substring. `$json-contains` matches whole-document containment (PG `@>`), e.g. `["$json-contains", {"tags": ["rust"]}]`.

### `$triple` Operator

The `$triple` operator provides position-based matching on statement triples. Each argument corresponds to head, relation, or tail. Use `"$*"` as a wildcard to match any value.

```
["$triple", <head_pattern>, <relation_pattern>, <tail_pattern>]
```

| Pattern | Meaning |
|---------|---------|
| `"Alice"` | Exact match |
| `"$*"` | Wildcard — match any value |

**Behavior**:
- All 3 specified (no wildcards): uses `triple = ?` (primary key lookup, fastest)
- Partial match: generates conditions on individual columns (`head = ? AND tail = ?`, etc.)
- At least one non-wildcard required — all wildcards is an error
- Arguments must be exactly 3

| User says | JSE | Command |
|---|---|---|
| "find all relationships where Alice is the head" | `["$statement", ["$triple", "Alice", "$*", "$*"]]` | `hypatia query '["$statement", ["$triple", "Alice", "$*", "$*"]]'` |
| "find all knows relationships" | `["$statement", ["$triple", "$*", "knows", "$*"]]` | `hypatia query '["$statement", ["$triple", "$*", "knows", "$*"]]'` |
| "find everything related to Bob as tail" | `["$statement", ["$triple", "$*", "$*", "Bob"]]` | `hypatia query '["$statement", ["$triple", "$*", "$*", "Bob"]]'` |
| "find the exact Alice knows Bob triple" | `["$statement", ["$triple", "Alice", "knows", "Bob"]]` | `hypatia query '["$statement", ["$triple", "Alice", "knows", "Bob"]]'` |
| "Alice's relationships with Bob, combined with date filter" | `["$statement", ["$and", ["$triple", "Alice", "$*", "Bob"], ["$gt", "created_at", "2025-01-01"]]]` | `hypatia query '["$statement", ["$and", ["$triple", "Alice", "$*", "Bob"], ["$gt", "created_at", "2025-01-01"]]]'` |

### `$like` Operator

SQL LIKE pattern matching with user-defined wildcards (`%` = any chars, `_` = single char).

```
["$like", "field", "pattern"]
```

| User says | JSE | Command |
|---|---|---|
| "find entries whose name starts with Rust" | `["$knowledge", ["$like", "name", "Rust%"]]` | `hypatia query '["$knowledge", ["$like", "name", "Rust%"]]'` |
| "find entries created in January 2025" | `["$knowledge", ["$like", "created_at", "2025-01-%"]]` | `hypatia query '["$knowledge", ["$like", "created_at", "2025-01-%"]]'` |
| "find statements with head matching pattern" | `["$statement", ["$like", "head", "Alice%"]]` | `hypatia query '["$statement", ["$like", "head", "Alice%"]]'` |

### `$content` Operator

Match key-value pairs inside the `content` JSON column. Checks exact string equality for each specified key.

```
["$content", {"key1": "value1", "key2": "value2"}]
```

| User says | JSE | Command |
|---|---|---|
| "find all markdown-format entries" | `["$knowledge", ["$content", {"format": "markdown"}]]` | `hypatia query '["$knowledge", ["$content", {"format": "markdown"}]]'` |
| "find json-format statements" | `["$statement", ["$content", {"format": "json"}]]` | `hypatia query '["$statement", ["$content", {"format": "json"}]]'` |
| "find entries with specific data and format" | `["$knowledge", ["$content", {"format": "markdown", "data": "hello"}]]` | `hypatia query '["$knowledge", ["$content", {"format": "markdown", "data": "hello"}]]'` |

### `$k-hop` Operator

K-hop graph traversal on statement triples using recursive CTE. Explores entity neighborhoods and relationship paths.

```
["$k-hop", "head", "relation", depth]
```

- `"head"` — starting entity (required)
- `"relation"` — filter by relation, or use `"$*"` for any
- `depth` — number of hops (positive integer)

| User says | JSE | Command |
|---|---|---|
| "who can Alice reach in 2 hops?" | `["$statement", ["$k-hop", "Alice", "$*", 2]]` | `hypatia query '["$statement", ["$k-hop", "Alice", "$*", 2]]'` |
| "what's reachable from Alice via knows in 3 hops?" | `["$statement", ["$k-hop", "Alice", "knows", 3]]` | `hypatia query '["$statement", ["$k-hop", "Alice", "knows", 3]]'` |
| "explore the graph around PostgreSQL" | `["$statement", ["$k-hop", "PostgreSQL", "$*", 2]]` | `hypatia query '["$statement", ["$k-hop", "PostgreSQL", "$*", 2]]'` |

### Natural Language to JSE Examples

| User says | JSE | Command |
|---|---|---|
| "find knowledge named rust" | `["$knowledge", ["$eq", "name", "rust"]]` | `hypatia query '["$knowledge", ["$eq", "name", "rust"]]'` |
| "find all relationships involving Alice" | `["$statement", ["$triple", "Alice", "$*", "$*"]]` | `hypatia query '["$statement", ["$triple", "Alice", "$*", "$*"]]'` |
| "who does Alice know?" | `["$statement", ["$triple", "Alice", "knows", "$*"]]` | `hypatia query '["$statement", ["$triple", "Alice", "knows", "$*"]]'` |
| "what type of things relate to Bob?" | `["$statement", ["$triple", "$*", "$*", "Bob"]]` | `hypatia query '["$statement", ["$triple", "$*", "$*", "Bob"]]'` |
| "find knowledge named rust that contains 'systems' in tags" | `["$knowledge", ["$and", ["$eq", "name", "rust"], ["$contains", "tags", "systems"]]]` | `hypatia query '["$knowledge", ["$and", ["$eq", "name", "rust"], ["$contains", "tags", "systems"]]]'` |
| "find knowledge NOT named rust" | `["$knowledge", ["$not", ["$eq", "name", "rust"]]]` | `hypatia query '["$knowledge", ["$not", ["$eq", "name", "rust"]]]'` |
| "find all is_a relationships" | `["$statement", ["$triple", "$*", "is_a", "$*"]]` | `hypatia query '["$statement", ["$triple", "$*", "is_a", "$*"]]'` |
| "find entries whose name starts with 'Al'" | `["$knowledge", ["$like", "name", "Al%"]]` | `hypatia query '["$knowledge", ["$like", "name", "Al%"]]'` |
| "show all knowledge" | `["$knowledge"]` | `hypatia query '["$knowledge"]'` |
| "find knowledge created after 2025-01-01" | `["$knowledge", ["$gt", "created_at", "2025-01-01"]]` | `hypatia query '["$knowledge", ["$gt", "created_at", "2025-01-01"]]'` |
| "find knowledge containing 'language' in data" | `["$knowledge", ["$contains", "data", "language"]]` | `hypatia query '["$knowledge", ["$contains", "data", "language"]]'` |

### Options (limit, offset, catalog)

Use object form for the top-level operator to pass options:

```json
{"$knowledge": [["$search", "rust"]], "limit": 10, "offset": 0}
```

Command: `hypatia query '{"$knowledge": [["$search", "rust"]], "limit": 10}'`

## Disambiguation Rules

When the user's request is ambiguous, follow this priority:

1. **Exact name mentioned** ("get Rust", "show Alice") → `knowledge-get` for direct lookup
2. **Explicit type** ("find knowledge about X" / "find statements about X") → JSE query with the corresponding top-level operator
3. **Relationship language** ("who does Alice know?", "what is Rust related to?", "relationships of X") → JSE `$statement` query with `$triple` operator
4. **Graph exploration** ("who can Alice reach?", "what's connected to X", "neighborhood of X") → JSE with `$k-hop` operator
5. **Semantic/similarity** ("find similar to X", "things like X", "semantically related") → `hypatia similar` (vector search)
6. **Pattern matching** ("names starting with X", "entries from January") → JSE with `$like` operator
7. **Content filtering** ("markdown entries", "entries with format X") → JSE with `$content` operator
8. **Broad/ambiguous** ("find everything about X", "what do you know about X") → `hypatia search` (covers both knowledge and statements)
9. **Create/store/remember** → knowledge-create + statement-create (always create relationships alongside knowledge entries)

## Shell Escaping

Always wrap JSE JSON in **single quotes** to prevent shell interpretation of `$`, `"`, `!`, etc.:

```bash
hypatia query '["$knowledge", ["$eq", "name", "rust"]]'
```

If the content contains single quotes, escape them:

```bash
hypatia query '["$knowledge", ["$eq", "name", "Alice'\''s project"]]'
```

## Output Format

- **Knowledge entries**: `{"name": "...", "content": {"format": "...", "data": "...", "tags": [...]}, "created_at": "..."}`
- **Statements**: `{"triple": "head,relation,tail", "head": "...", "relation": "...", "tail": "...", "content": {...}, "created_at": "...", "tr_start": "...", "tr_end": "..."}`
- **Search results**: `{"id": N, "catalog": "...", "key": "...", "content": "...", "rank": N.N}`
- **Empty results**: prints "No results found."

## Sandboxed / Read-Only Direct Access (known workaround)

When running inside a sandboxed harness (e.g. DSH `workspace-write`), the hypatia CLI and plain
`sqlite3 ~/.hypatia/...` may both fail with SQLite error 14 (`unable to open database file`):
even read-only SQLite needs to create WAL/journal temp files next to the database, and
`~/.hypatia` lies outside the writable workspace. **Do not retry the same failing command** —
go straight to the immutable read-only URI, which needs no journal and no directory writes:

```bash
sqlite3 "file:$HOME/.hypatia/default/hypatia.sqlite?mode=ro&immutable=1" "SELECT count(*) FROM knowledge;"
```

- Use only for **reads** (SELECT). Never write through this path — `immutable=1` tells SQLite the
  file never changes, so writes would corrupt state or be lost.
- Adjust the shelf path for non-default shelves (`~/.hypatia/<shelf>/<db>.sqlite`).
- First, locate the actual DB file: `ls ~/.hypatia/*/` (also check `-wal`/`-shm` siblings; if a
  WAL exists and is non-empty, `immutable=1` may miss recent un-checkpointed rows — in that case
  prefer requesting wider sandbox permissions for a normal read instead).
- Schema hints: tables include `knowledge` and `statement`; statement triples are stored in
  `head` / `relation` / `tail` columns.

This fallback was validated: the same query fails at error 14 without the URI params and returns
correctly with them.

## Important Notes

- There is no `statement-get` CLI command. Use JSE queries (`$statement` with conditions) to find statements. `statement-delete` is available for deletion.
- The `-s` / `--shelf` flag defaults to `"default"` for all commands.
- The REPL mode (`hypatia repl`) is interactive and should NOT be used from this skill. Always use one-shot CLI commands.
- Content (`-d`) is stored as a string in the content JSON's `data` field.
- Tags (`-t`) are comma-separated strings.
- **Always create statements alongside knowledge entries** to maintain graph connectivity. Every knowledge entry should have at least one corresponding `is_a` statement.
- **Normalize relative temporal expressions to absolute dates/times before storing.** When content contains "明天", "下周一", "三小时后", "tonight", etc., rewrite them using the current date/time as the reference point. Example: "明天提醒我备份数据" → store "2026年8月29日提醒我备份数据". A relative date is meaningless when the memory is recalled later.
